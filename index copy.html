        <h3>What UI elements did I see?</h3>
        <p>While finding the item, Walmart's navigation bar has dropdown menus that
            allow users to search for items by department, and also a search bar. The
            items are tiled across the page in a grid.

            Common lalyout to provide large image of the produce in the middle of the page. Another common 
            element is the right pane that has all the information about reviews, size, 
            color options that user can choose
        </p>

        <h3>Have I seen this UI element before?</h3>
        <p>Standard when it comes to components – pretty similar to other shopping websites.

            Option selector shows preview of other options. This options to be able to select certain options 
            of the same product and view them at the same tab makes it very 
            convenient for the user to compare and contrast.

            Walmart’s “add to cart” button morphs into another button that allows the user to change the 
            quantity of the item that the user selects. It’s not expected but a useful 
            combination of the “buy” function and “quantity” function

            The bolded lines that is used to highlight selected options of the product is a 
            good indicator user of what version of the product they have chosen

            Target offers various filters and categorization so that users can find the specific item that they want easily

UI elements are similar to walmart

Target offers a left side plane that user can use to filter out various items. It’s more prominent in it’s space and user can spot it pretty clearly

With electronics, since there’s many products with similar specs, Target focuses on being able to filter results to narrow down options for the user

When clicking on a certain item, the page leads to detailed page of the product

Target makes clear indication of information hierarchy by placing certain text and buttons on the very top space of the webpage. The website provides description but it’s placed at a lower space of the website and the text is smaller, which is a purposeful design to convince user to buy products.
