        <h3>What UI elements did I see?</h3>
        <p>While finding the item, Walmart's navigation bar has dropdown menus that
            allow users to search for items by department, and also a search bar. The
            items are tiled across the page in a grid.

            Common lalyout to provide large image of the produce in the middle of the page. Another common 
            element is the right pane that has all the information about reviews, size, 
            color options that user can choose
        </p>

        <h3>Have I seen this UI element before?</h3>
        <p>Standard when it comes to components – pretty similar to other shopping websites. 
            Because most of the elements follow the standardized design it’s easy to understand what the elements of the websites are going to perform.</p>

            Option selector shows preview of other options. This options to be able to select certain options 
            of the same product and view them at the same tab makes it very 
            convenient for the user to compare and contrast.

            Walmart’s “add to cart” button morphs into another button that allows the user to change the 
            quantity of the item that the user selects. It’s not expected but a useful 
            combination of the “buy” function and “quantity” function

            The bolded lines that is used to highlight selected options of the product is a 
            good indicator user of what version of the product they have chosen

            Target offers various filters and categorization so that users can find the specific item that they want easily

UI elements are similar to walmart

Target offers a left side plane that user can use to filter out various items. It’s more prominent in it’s space and user can spot it pretty clearly

With electronics, since there’s many products with similar specs, Target focuses on being able to filter results to narrow down options for the user

When clicking on a certain item, the page leads to detailed page of the product

Target makes clear indication of information hierarchy by placing certain text and buttons on the very top space of the webpage. The website provides description but it’s placed at a lower space of the website and the text is smaller, which is a purposeful design to convince user to buy products.

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h3>What elements or patterns seem universal?</h3>
        <p>The pattern of emphasizing filters and categories nearby search bar so that the user understands they have other methods of looking for the item without knowing the specific name for it. </p>
        <p>The color scheme that directly represents the company’s brand identity. Certain colors such as red were used by some websites to highlight activities such as purchasing.</p>
        <p>The focus of image representation of the product once user selects it. Most of the time selection of the certain image from the grid pattern leads to enlarged iaged and description of the item and price. It was also common for these pages to have a right-hand panel that allowed the user to 
          customize the item that they selected.</p>
      
        <h3>Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?</h3>
        <p>I think by difference in business model, such as Etsy that promotes individual sellers, creates a need for different interface that highlights different information. It is likely that websites like Etsy highlight user reviews and logistics of ordering and receiving the item since the website 
          is only a hosting page to many different sellers that are not under management. /p>
        <p>Also food selling websites don’t specify the price until the user have chosen everysingle option since price my differ greatly due to customization.</p>
      
        <h3>Any stand out patterns? Could any other stores have applied that technique?</h3>
        <p>The stand out pattern was definitely how Walmart integrated the purchase and quantity selection option. Most of the time user may oversee the option to increase the quantity of the item they’re purchasing, but because the purchase button automatically leads to suggesting different quantity, 
          it is more likely to convince users to consume more than they thought they would before. I see big brands like Target or even Etsy employing this technique since they would want to convince their users to buy more of the same products they’re offering. </p>

        <h3>How did you feel when interacting with these sites?</h3>
        <p>I felt like I knew most of the things that were happening. I understood what the purpose of these websites were an I had no trouble figuring out the next step when I found a product I would like to purchase.</p>
