* I need to have more visual clarity on my main page and my search page and have clear indication of where user can go back and forth between pages
* I need to have a better way of navigating throughout the website (maybe a dropdown menu or hamberger menu bar) and have visible navigation that is consistent
* I need to refine my shopping page and have less information and make it easier to see and understand
* I want to refine my user survey and have a better listing/ comparison page for matching results
* I want to have a more clear indication for user-survey/quiz that can lead new users to easier search for their bike
* I want to have more information to guide or assist users that have previous knowledge of bikes and knows that’s they’re looking for
* I want to have more clear and separate category and listing of pages instead of having all of them on one page so user can understand what they’re looking at 
* I want to make a clickable wireframe
